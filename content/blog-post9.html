</p>

<p>We are regularly encouraged to snack as part of our healthy diet, as long as we eat mindfully . The key to healthy snacking is being conscious of when, what and how we snack. Paying attention to all these will put us on the path to a healthy lifestyle. A well-timed snack can take care of our hunger pangs and necessitate energy boost between meals. With the simple but powerful act of snacking, we can reverse our lifestyle any time! How hard is it? You should take time for the smaller bites and enjoy them regularly before your longer meals. Here are five of the best timing to improve nutrition and encourage smart snacking habits:
                                     </p>
<p>
1.We are generally advised to take small courses in between our main meals , probably once in every four hours. If we delay in feeding our tummy for more than four hours, the body metabolism gets affected and blood sugar level drops! Not to forget that if one waits too long to eat, he/she will be end up overeating! Hence, it is always a good practice to make sure to have healthy snacks on hand.
</p>

<p> 
2. According to a study, skipping breakfast will make us extremely ravenous and we will end up eating large meals which it will result in an increase in blood sugar. Furthermore, those days when we happen to eat earlier, we tend to burn those calories sooner! Hence munching on healthy snacks during the morning hours will help steer through our hectic workdays!
</p>

<p>  
3. Whenever we feel groggy during work, snacking on healthy alternatives will help to enhance our concentration and focus on work!
</p>

<p> 
4. Replenishing our body with essential carbohydrates and proteins after an intense workout is a must.
</p>

<p> 
5. Everytime when we are travelling out of town or hanging out with friend's for a party , we will be forced to make bad, unhealthy food choices. Therefore, it is important to have nourishing meal before heading out! Also it is best to always carry some small, handy packs of healthy snacks in our travel bag.
