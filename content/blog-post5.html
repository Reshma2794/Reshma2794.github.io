                                      <p> During that time of the day, when the dusk sets in, when our bodies are almost enervated, we need rejuvenation. A cup of beverage might work well for the mind but the stomach demands more. Snacks, which may range from the simplest of a chocolate bar to a large packet of crisps satiate the demands of the stomach and also lingers well with our taste buds.</p>
<p>       Although snacks time is trivial in comparison with breakfast, lunch or dinner, they are a hit amongst every age group. After-all, what better a delighting presence than that of a bowl full of snacks for a human being who returns home exhausted? As the break-time bell rings, children await their chance to open the ‘mini-treasure’ boxes (Exaggeration intended) and instead of jewels and gems, we have sweets and savouries! Snacking has been there from time immemorial and the food industry has been benefitted by the huge sales of snack items that are not more than few centimetres in size like that of a toffee. </p> <br>

 <h4>  SNACKING- THE FOOD HABIT WITHOUT A PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD </h4>

<p>  Even though it is the evening which has been allotted has the ideal time period for snacks, we’ve not always stuck to the itinerary as we consume snacks throughout the day whenever our stomach growls. One could argue with me that the habit of consuming snacks throughout the day instead of one particular time period during the 24 hours in a day results out of improper consumption of other three meals. Excessive snacking has adverse effects linked with it and the most dreadful among them is obesity. In my opinion, snacking doesn’t fit into a particular time slot in a day and we can have it whenever we desire but I also oppose the habit of consuming snacks as an alternative to meals.</p> <br>

<h4> SNACKS - A MISUNDERSTOOD CONCEPT </h4> 

<p> Wiki says ‘A snack is a portion of food, smaller than a regular meal, generally eaten between meals. Snacks come in a variety of forms including packaged snack foods and other processed foods, as well as items made from fresh ingredients at home.’ We’ve designated a time slot for snacks like how everything has been designated a suitable time and place. But there is huge misconception regarding the food items that we consume as snack. Dry Fruits and nuts, salad, sweets and savouries are some of the typically favoured snacks among most of the countries. Although snack’s definition states that it is a food having less quantity than a meal, we often eat them without planning also during our spare time. Keeping good food nearby and having meals right on time certainly helps in this direction.</p> <br>

<h4> HEALTH IS A MUST- EVEN WITH SNACKS </h4>

<p> There is a growing concern to prevent the consumption of high calorie, low-nutrient food items as it leads to harmful effects. Obesity, as previously stated is only one among the long list of health problems that arise out of improper snacking practices. Food that consists of high levels of calories (empty calories) with no or less vitamins and minerals which also have ingredients considered as unhealthy when eaten regularly, are termed ‘Junk Food’ .Increased consumption of junk food among children in particular has led to increased risk in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, weight gain and many further chronic health problems. Obesity among children is contributed massively due to increased consumption of junk food and not integrating healthy food items into the balanced diet.  </p>

<p> This has led to another misconception that snacking only includes junk food and usually the less informed parents either provide their children with excess of junk during snacks or advertisements were making it difficult for them to promote healthy eating at home. But healthy snacks isn’t a completely new concept and a healthy snacks are those which have significant vitamins, are low in saturated fat and added sugars, and have a low sodium content. Some of the examples of healthy snack ideas are as follows </p>
<p>

<ul style="font-family:Montserrat;font-weight:bold;">
<li> Foods that have whole grains </li>
<li> Nuts and seeds </li>
<li> Fruits and vegetables </li>
<li> Low-fat dairy products </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> Incorporating these food items into our balanced diet replenishes our body and does wonders and keeps health issues at bay. </p>
<p> SnackExperts has been established in order to clear people from the misconception that snacking is a bad practice and in order to throw light on consuming healthy snacks. </p>

This means that although snacks are lesser in quantity than the regular meal, having anything as a snack also has certain effects associated with it and it’s high time we re-examine our snacking habits in order to obtain taste and health at the same time from the food we consume.
