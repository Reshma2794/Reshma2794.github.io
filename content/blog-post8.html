<br> Whenever my friends tell me they eat healthy, but still can’t lose their weight, I always ask them "Do you eat mindfully? " Pretty much I get a response either "No" or they just stare me back wondering what on earth I'm talking about. It is needless to say when and what you eat is important, but how you eat makes a massive difference!
</p>

<p>
Perhaps! Eating is a routine, mandatory and a healthy activity for satisfying hunger. However, in our hectic daily lives we all rush through the day, with no time to get a bite or trail around with heedless eating habit while watching TV, reading books, surfing and the worst would be talking in mobile with food in your mouth . This sort of distractions while eating will assist you to overeat. It's no wonder due to the fact that we can't remember properly of what we ate, we gobble it down. Certainly it's a powerful fact that without the information of what went into your mouth, you may nab into thinking for a big meal . In between it is our food , the last stuff on our mind when we eat, this could be a weight-gain surprise at the end of the year.
</p>

<p>
“Food is a great pleasure in our life – not something we should compromise. We simply need to shift our surroundings to work with our lifestyle instead of against it“ says Brian Wansink, professor and director of the Cornell University. So, No amount of guilt can solve the past and no amount of anxiety can change the future. Don't worry ! Bad habits are meant to be broken. Hence we decided to provide a comprehensive plan that you can implement right away for a healthy lifestyle. Here is how we help you understand the way to eat and overcome some common mindless eating behaviors.
</p>

<p> <h4> 1. Sit down </h4>
</p>

<p>
Whenever we sit down to eat, we are inherently more focused, pause before you take a bite and become aware of each thing on your plate (for less than five seconds). Try slowing your eating pace a little. Take up a couple of minutes while eating, put down all your utensils and focus on nutriment. In addition to this, Sitting down to eat also helps you keep track of what we are eating, which means we are more likely to pick out healthy choices and that will also help our body to recognize from how much we are consuming to the filled up state to prevent a pig-out later on.
</p>

<p>
<h4> 2. Savor</h4>
</p>

<p>
Take time to savor, it is one of the healthiest way to relish on your foodstuffs . Moreover savoring each and every bite of what you consume will make your food delicious as sustenance it is. Furthermore you will feel absolutely satisfied with a distinctly less quantity of food, which can help with weight loss owing to the fact you will be eating only fewer calories. Apparently, if you want to experience how it feels in your mouth: Take your favourite dried fruit ( I choose raisins ) just a five to six raisins at a time, now eat them slowly and mindfully. As you chew them try to write down the texture, its aroma and the taste you feel them in your mouth. An added bonus of this technique is, it may also help you become more creative in the kitchen.
</p>
 <p> <h4> 3. Chew Slowly </h4> </p>

<p> 
Chewing is probably the simplest and most effective way to develop the habit of eating mindfully. Take mini bites and chew them well. Eating slowly and paying attention to food, can be a great form of mindfulness exercise. Whenever we eat slower, we will tend to chew our food better, that in turn leads to better digestion. Basically the digestion process begins in the mouth, so the more work you do up here, the less you will have to do in your stomach.
</p>

<p>  <h4> 4. Pay attention </h4> </p>

<p>
Put away your phone, turn off the TV, try to enjoy no less than one meal with your family, Smile between your meals. Smiling helps to pump feel-good chemicals in your mind and body that can reduce your stress and emotional eating. We eat better, not just from a nutritional perspective, but from a psychological one as well. Any sensation that you feel other than taste and smell while you are eating can distract you and then your prudent eating becomes more difficult. Use this 4 essential tips to guide yourself and family in the direction of healthy lifestyle.
